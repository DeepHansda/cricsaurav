                Fantasy Cricket Apps: Fantasy cricket is a part of the Fantasy
                Sports genre. It is an online game where you create a virtual
                team of real cricket players and score points depending on how
                your chosen players perform in real-life matches. To win a
                tournament, you must work towards attaining the maximum points
                and the No. 1 rank on the leader-board. e.g. ICC IPL Fantasy
                league, IPL 2022 Fantasy league, etc…

                A Fantasy Cricket Match is based on batting and bowling orders
                which are the most debated part of the cricketing strategy. A
                little change in order can change the course of the game. The
                concept involves selecting a team of 11 players from the pool of
                players who will play the match.

                <br />
                There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to
                a particular number of batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders. A
                fantasy team can have any type of player. The main aim of a
                Fantasy Cricket Match is to out-score the opposition by as big a
                margin as possible. Fantasy cricket matches can be played in all
                3 international forms: One Day International, Twenty20, and Test
                Cricket.
